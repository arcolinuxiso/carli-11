# ArcoLinuxIso Carli

To be able to build you install this package

Build your iso by running script 30 or 40 in the folder
installation scripts.

Archiso will be installed if not present.
Carli keys will be installed if not present.
Carli mirrors will be installed if not present.

Do check out the archiso.readme. There may be a difference between archiso 
versions. That may lead to different results.

Use the correct version of archiso.

Start building your own carli version with the use of the scripts.
Change the files - packages.x86_64 being the most important.

## 💛 A Grateful Farewell from the ArcoLinux Team

After many years of building, sharing, and learning together, the **ArcoLinux project is winding down**.

Although no new updates or packages will be released, we are proud of the knowledge, tools, and community that have grown around ArcoLinux.

### What's Staying Online ✅

- 🌐 **Websites** will remain accessible for several years
- 🎥 **YouTube videos** will stay online and continue to serve as tutorials
- 📦 **GitHub repositories** like this one will remain available as long as GitHub's free hosting allows

### Keep Using and Updating Your System 🛠️

ArcoLinux was always built on **Arch Linux**, which is a **rolling release**.  
This means your system can still be installed and updated using standard Arch tools and knowledge.
